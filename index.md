I am currently a research analyst at the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland. My primary research interests are inflation expectations, asset pricing, and time series econometrics (see here for published work). 

I am also the author of *Next Year in America*, a history, as its subtitle so wisely puts it, "of Eastern European Jews in the old and new worlds." It tells the often forgotten or underappreciated story of Jewish immigration to the United States between 1880 and 1924 while also providing ample context about life before and after that period. But rather than attempting to allow the historical record to speak for itself, I tell the story with plenty of help from the experiences of my own (and very ordinary) ancestors. See here for more information.

When not consumed by economic or genealogical research, I also write and record music. I have been publishing instrumental music under my own name since 2015 (a complete discography is available here; the most worthwhile tracks are on all streaming services), and have now released two albums (with vocals, regrettably) under the name Desert Fathers (also available on all streaming services).
