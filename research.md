* *Coming soon:* new work that brings a model with rationally inattentive consumers to consumer survey data; testing forecast efficiency when the forecasted variable follows a more general data generating process, and when forecasts are made with noisy information and/or imperfect memory recall; assessing the efficiency and behavior of revisions to the BEA's state-level GDP estimates; documenting changes in net worth for different age groups between the 2019 and 2022 Surveys of Consumer Finance; using supervisory data on banks to better inform DSGE models with financial sectors; and more...
 
* ["Practice Makes Perfect: Learning Effects with Household Point and Density Forecasts of Inflation."](https://doi.org/10.26509/frbc-wp-202425) *Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland Working Paper Series*, WP 24-25 (with James Mitchell and Hana Braitsch). 
  * From the abstract: This paper shows how both the characteristics and the accuracy of the point and density forecasts from a well-known panel data survey of households' inflationary expectations – the New York Fed's Survey of Consumer Expectations – depend on the tenure of survey respondents. Households' point and density forecasts of inflation become significantly more accurate with repeated practice of completing the survey. These learning gains are best identified when tenure-based combination forecasts are constructed. Tenured households on average produce lower point forecasts of inflation, perceive less forecast uncertainty, round their uncertainty but not their point forecasts, report unimodal densities, and provide internally consistent point and density forecasts.
* ["The Effects of Interest Rate Increases on Consumers' Inflation Expectations: The Roles of Informedness and Compliance."](https://doi.org/10.26509/frbc-wp-202401) *Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland Working Paper Series*, WP 24-01 (with Edward S. Knotek II, James Mitchell, and Mathieu Pedemonte).
  * From the abstract: We study how monetary policy communications associated with increasing the federal funds rate causally affect consumers' inflation expectations. In a large-scale, multi-wave randomized controlled trial (RCT), we find weak evidence on average that communicating policy changes lowers consumers' medium-term inflation expectations. However, information differs systematically across demographic groups, in terms of ex ante informedness about monetary policy and ex post compliance with the information treatment. Monetary policy communications have a much stronger effect on people who had not previously heard news about monetary policy and who take sufficient time to read the treatment, implying scope to increase the impact of communications by targeting specific groups of the general public. Our findings show that, in an inflationary environment, consumers expect that raising interest rates will lower inflation. More generally, our results emphasize the importance of measuring both respondents' information sets and their compliance with treatment when using RCTs in empirical macroeconomics, to better understand the well-documented evidence of heterogeneous treatment effects.
* ["The Survey of Firms’ Inflation Expectations.”](https://doi.org/10.26509/frbc-ec-202310) *Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland Economic Commentary* EC 2023-10 (with Christian Garciga, Edward S. Knotek II, and Mathieu Pedemonte).
  * From the abstract: This Economic Commentary summarizes results from the Survey of Firms’ Inflation Expectations (SoFIE), which asks top business executives for their inflation expectations once per quarter alongside a second question from a rotating set. We document that this group’s inflation expectations increased with the run-up in inflation over 2021 and 2022 but then began to decline in early 2023. 

A number of old blog posts, mostly about monetary policy and macroeconomics, are available on [my Substack](https://taylorshiroff.substack.com), which inexplicably still has over 600 subscribers despite long being dormant. I have also guest written [an article over at Joey Politano's *Apricitas*](https://www.apricitas.io/p/why-we-shouldnt-doom-over-labor-force) (I also happened to make Joey's ["Best of the Best" list for 2022](https://www.apricitas.io/p/the-best-of-the-best-who-to-follow)!), as well as for [Exponents Magazine](https://cnliberalism.org/2021/09/29/its-time-for-a-new-debt-ceiling/) (link may be dead).
