  * From the abstract: We study how monetary policy communications associated with increasing the federal funds rate causally affect consumers' inflation expectations. In a large-scale, multi-wave randomized controlled trial (RCT), we find weak evidence on average that communicating policy changes lowers consumers' medium-term inflation expectations. However, information differs systematically across demographic groups, in terms of ex ante informedness about monetary policy and ex post compliance with the information treatment. Monetary policy communications have a much stronger effect on people who had not previously heard news about monetary policy and who take sufficient time to read the treatment, implying scope to increase the impact of communications by targeting specific groups of the general public. Our findings show that, in an inflationary environment, consumers expect that raising interest rates will lower inflation. More generally, our results emphasize the importance of measuring both respondents' information sets and their compliance with treatment when using RCTs in empirical macroeconomics, to better understand the well-documented evidence of heterogeneous treatment effects.

  * From the abstract: This Economic Commentary summarizes results from the Survey of Firms’ Inflation Expectations (SoFIE), which asks top business executives for their inflation expectations once per quarter alongside a second question from a rotating set. We document that this group’s inflation expectations increased with the run-up in inflation over 2021 and 2022 but then began to decline in early 2023. 

A number of old blog posts written for my Substack (which inexplicably still has over 500 subscribers) are also available [here](https://taylorshiroff.substack.com). I have also guest written [an article over at Joey Politano's *Apricitas*](https://www.apricitas.io/p/why-we-shouldnt-doom-over-labor-force) (I also happened to make Joey's ["Best of the Best" list](https://www.apricitas.io/p/the-best-of-the-best-who-to-follow) for 2022!), as well as for [Exponents Magazine](https://cnliberalism.org/2021/09/29/its-time-for-a-new-debt-ceiling/) (link may be dead :/).
