### Desert Fathers

A one-man-band of sorts, equally inspired by the dense production and generally melancholic atmosphere of the Cure, the jangly jazz chords of the Smiths, and the lyricism of legendary hometown heroes mewithoutYou. Two albums, each with an accompanying "appendix" EP, are available on most streaming platforms, including Apple Music, Spotify, and YouTube. 

### Instrumental music

Nearly a decade's worth of instrumental music is available on [Bandcamp](https://taylorshiroff.bandcamp.com). The best of this has been made available on most streaming platforms, including Apple Music, Spotify, and YouTube.
